# Hi, I'm Hanna! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me :hibiscus:
My name is Hanna HÃ¸idahl, I currently live in Oslo and I started my coding-journey in October 2023 when I enrolled into the Front-End Development programme at Noroff University. 

After almost 4 years working as a kitchen consultant and shiftleader at IKEA i decided that I wanted to explore something new. Having worked with a lot of different programmes every day, I have seen how the tech we use affects my co-workers and our customers. This made me really passionate about user experience and ended up leading me down this Front-End path so I could help develop user friendly tech solutions.

## My Skills :star2:
During my first year at Noroff I have learned:
- Design fundaments
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Responsive Design
- Accessability
- Project Methodology
- Vanilla JavaScript.

## What I Would Love To Lean Soon :sparkling_heart:
I'm currently working on enhancing my skills in JavaScript, and I would love to learn how to work wiht libraries and frameworks soon.
